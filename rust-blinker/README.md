# [БК-0010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektronika_BK) Emulator

## Project Description

A **БК-0010 (Elektronika BK) emulator** running on the [XCore407I](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/XCore407I) development board, based on the STM32F407IGT6 microcontroller.

The project uses an unusual approach to multimedia I/O:

- **Video:** Streamed directly to the PC as a USB Video Class (UVC) camera at **25 FPS**, using uncompressed NV12 video.
- **Audio:** Transmitted to the PC through a USB Line In audio device.
- **Input:** A physical USB keyboard connected to a separate USB port, using the STM32's USB Host functionality.
- **Storage:** Reads files from a LittleFS filesystem stored on the onboard K9F1G08U0E 1-Gbit (128 MB) NAND Flash. Files can be launched directly from the filesystem. Adding files to LittleFS is outside the scope of this project.

## Hardware

The XCore407I board provides the hardware required for the emulator:

- **STM32F407IGT6:** ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller running at 168 MHz, with 192 KB SRAM and 1 MB Flash.
- **USB3300:** External USB High-Speed PHY, providing the physical interface for USB video and audio.
- **K9F1G08U0E:** 1-Gbit NAND Flash (128 MB) for LittleFS storage.
- **USB interfaces:** USB High-Speed device connection for UVC video and USB Line In audio, and a separate USB Full-Speed Host connection for the keyboard.

## Technical Challenges

- **RAM constraints:** The STM32F407 has only 192 KB of SRAM, insufficient to store a complete 512×512 NV12 video frame. Video must therefore be generated and streamed on the fly, without a full-frame buffer.
- **USB complexity:** Coordinating UVC video streaming and USB Line In audio over the High-Speed USB device connection, while handling keyboard input through a separate Full-Speed USB Host connection.
- **Performance:** Maintaining stable 25 FPS video alongside continuous audio requires careful interrupt prioritization, synchronization, and CPU-load management.
- **NAND Flash integration:** Implementing reliable LittleFS access on raw NAND Flash, including handling its block-oriented storage characteristics.

The project explores how far a resource-constrained microcontroller can be pushed to emulate a vintage computer while interfacing with a modern PC through standard multimedia and USB interfaces.
